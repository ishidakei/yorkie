//! Static Exchange Evaluation "greater-or-equal" test, ported from
//! `Position::see_ge` (`position.cpp`).
//!
//! `see_ge(m, threshold)` is `true` iff the material swing of the optimal
//! capture / recapture sequence on `m`'s destination is at least `threshold`.
//! It is a null-window swap: resolve each side's least-valuable attacker in
//! turn, updating a running bound, and exit once the decision is settled.
//!
//! Three things the reference does that surprise:
//!
//! * The moving piece's own promotion is **not** credited — the value used is
//!   that of the piece as it stands on `from`. The reference notes it drops the
//!   promotion gain deliberately, to keep the early cutoff valid. A piece
//!   already promoted on the board does contribute its promoted value.
//! * `ROOK` is tried before `HORSE` in the least-valuable-attacker order even
//!   though a horse is worth less. Node-count parity depends on it.
//! * The pinned-piece guard drops `blockers_for_king(stm)` from the attacker
//!   set only while a pinner is still on the board.
