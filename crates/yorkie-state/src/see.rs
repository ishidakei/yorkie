//! Static Exchange Evaluation "greater-or-equal" test (`see_ge`), ported from
//! upstream YaneuraOu's `Position::see_ge`
//! (`source/position.cpp`, the `#if !STOCKFISH` shogi path)
//! at the current submodule pin.
//!
//! `see_ge(m, threshold)` returns `true` iff the static exchange evaluation of
//! move `m` — the material swing of the optimal capture/recapture sequence on
//! `m`'s destination square — is greater than or equal to `threshold`. The
//! algorithm is a null-window swap over the destination square: it alternately
//! resolves the least-valuable attacker of each side, updating a running
//! `swap` bound, and early-exits the moment the threshold decision is settled.
//!
//! Faithful-port notes (all mirroring the reference exactly):
//!
//! * The moving piece's own promotion is **not** credited — `see_ge` uses the
//!   *unpromoted* value of the piece standing on `from` (`type_of(piece_on
//!   (from))`), and the reference comment states the final promotion gain is
//!   deliberately ignored so the early cutoff stays valid. A piece that is
//!   *already* promoted on the board contributes its promoted value, both as
//!   the victim on `to` (`PieceValue[piece_on(to)]`) and as an attacker (a
//!   Tokin/`+P` is a GOLDS-bucket attacker worth `GoldValue`, a Horse is worth
//!   `HorseValue`, a Dragon `DragonValue`).
//! * Drops restore the moved piece's value from the dropped kind (there is no
//!   piece on `from`); a drop onto an empty square has victim value `0`.
//! * The least-valuable-attacker else-if order is preserved verbatim: PAWN,
//!   LANCE, KNIGHT, SILVER, GOLDS, BISHOP, ROOK, HORSE, DRAGON, KING — note
//!   ROOK is tried before HORSE even though `HorseValue < RookValue`; this is
//!   the reference ordering and node-count parity depends on it.
//! * The attacker set of both sides is collected **once** on the bitboard
//!   substrate ([`crate::movegen::attackers_bb_occ`], the table-driven
//!   `attackers_to(to, occupied)`) and then maintained incrementally, mirroring
//!   the reference's `attackers |= rayEffect<…>(to, occupied) & …` bookkeeping:
//!   each iteration drops consumed attackers (`attackers &= occupied`) and, when
//!   a non-knight attacker is removed, reveals the x-ray sliders standing behind
//!   it on the opened ray by recomputing the occupancy-limited slider query
//!   ([`reveal_sliders`]). Knights reveal nothing (they jump). This is
//!   behaviourally identical to re-deriving `attackers_to` against the mutated
//!   occupancy every step, since removing a piece can only open the single ray
//!   that passes through its square.
//! * The pinned-piece guard (`pinners(~stm) & occupied` ⇒ drop
//!   `blockers_for_king(stm)` from the attacker set) is ported from
//!   `update_slider_blockers`, computed once over the pre-move full board.
