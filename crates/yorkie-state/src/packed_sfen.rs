//! PackedSfen — the 32-byte Huffman position encoding, ported bit-for-bit from
//! `sfen_packer.cpp`.
//!
//! A `.ybb` opening-book index keys positions by this exact encoding, so any
//! single-bit divergence from the reference writer makes the index binary
//! search miss.
//!
//! Bits are packed least-significant-first within each byte, bytes ascending.
//! The serialization order is side to move, both king squares, the board in
//! square-index order with the kings skipped, both hands in Apery order, then
//! the "piece box" of every piece on neither the board nor in a hand. The box
//! pads the leftover pieces, so the width is a fixed 256 bits for any position
//! within the standard piece complement.
