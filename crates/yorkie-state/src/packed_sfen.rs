//! PackedSfen — the 256-bit (32-byte) Huffman position encoding, ported
//! bit-for-bit from the YaneuraOu reference
//! (`source/extra/sfen_packer.cpp`).
//!
//! The `.ybb` opening-book index keys positions by this exact encoding, so the
//! probe key we compute here must match, to the bit, what the reference writer
//! produced. Any single-bit divergence makes the index binary search miss.
//!
//! # Bit-stream convention
//!
//! Bits are packed least-significant-first within each byte, bytes ascending:
//! stream bit 0 is bit 0 (LSB) of `data[0]`; a byte fills LSB→MSB before the
//! cursor advances to the next byte (`sfen_packer.cpp`).
//!
//! # Serialization order (`SfenPacker::pack`, `sfen_packer.cpp`)
//!
//! 1. side to move — 1 bit (Black=0, White=1)
//! 2. black king square, then white king square — 7 bits each (`SQ_NB`=81 if
//!    absent)
//! 3. every square in index order `0..81`, kings skipped — Huffman board piece
//! 4. hand pieces: Black then White, in Apery order
//!    (Pawn, Lance, Knight, Silver, Gold, Bishop, Rook)
//! 5. the "piece box" — every piece not on the board or in a hand, same order
//!
//! For any position whose piece complement does not exceed the standard set the
//! cursor lands on exactly 256 bits; the piece box pads the leftover pieces so
//! the width is fixed.
