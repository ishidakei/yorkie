//! Gate for the one-ply mate detector (`Position::mate_1ply`).
//!
//! The detector is a faithful port of upstream YaneuraOu's `Mate::mate_1ply`
//! (`source/mate/mate1ply_without_effect.cpp`), including its
//! deliberate misses — so this gate does **not** assert completeness (it is a
//! non-goal to find every 1-ply mate the reference misses). What it pins is:
//!
//! 1. **Soundness (hermetic):** over seeded random playouts from the six perft
//!    fixtures, at every visited position where the side to move is not in check
//!    (the reference's `ASSERT_LV3(!checkers())` precondition), whenever
//!    `mate_1ply` returns a move it is (a) legal, (b) gives check, and (c) leaves
//!    the opponent with zero legal replies — i.e. it really is mate.
//! 2. **Determinism:** the same position yields the same result across repeated
//!    calls.
//! 3. A handful of hand-built positions with a known head-mate confirm the
//!    detector actually fires (guards against a vacuously-sound "always None").
//!
//! # Why there is no direct reference-parity test here
//!
//! No drivable reference entry point for `Mate::mate_1ply` exists in the pinned
//! submodule: it is exercised only from inside `yaneuraou-search.cpp` (the 一手
//! 詰め block), and none of the test commands (`source/testcmd/`, incl.
//! `mate_test_cmd.cpp` / `unit_test.cpp`) nor any USI extension exposes it
//! directly (`grep -rn mate_1ply source` finds only search-internal call sites).
//! Adding one would require patching the read-only submodule, which project
//! policy forbids. Exact (position → move / none) agreement is therefore
//! arbitrated indirectly, by the search node-count parity gates that run with
//! this detector wired into qsearch; this file supplies the hermetic soundness
//! and determinism gates.
