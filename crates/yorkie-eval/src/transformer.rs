//! Feature-transformer accumulator and its output transform.
//!
//! Ported from the read-only Rust NNUE reference implementation's
//! `transformer.rs` (refresh path). The per-lane kernels
//! (add/sub feature columns, the pairwise element-wise multiply) go through
//! [`crate::simd`], which picks the AVX-512 backend at compile time when the
//! build enables the features and the scalar baseline otherwise — bit-identical
//! either way.
//! The C++ ground truth is
//! `eval/nnue/nnue_feature_transformer.h` at the
//! current submodule pin.
//!
//! This module owns the accumulator type, its full-refresh path, the
//! incremental (do/undo) differential update, and the output transform that
//! packs the accumulator into the byte input buffer L1 (`fc_0`) consumes. The
//! layer-stack forward pass lives in [`crate::network`], the kernels in
//! [`crate::simd`].
//!
//! ## Incremental update ([`Accumulator::update_after_move`])
//!
//! Ported from the reference `update_on_move` / `update_on_king_move`
//! (the reference's `transformer.rs`) and the C++ `UpdateAccumulator` in
//! `nnue_feature_transformer.h`. Each perspective is derived from the pre-move
//! accumulator independently: a perspective whose own king moved is rebuilt from
//! scratch (see [`crate::features::requires_full_refresh`]); every other
//! perspective copies the previous half and applies the add/sub feature delta
//! ([`crate::features::changed_indices`]). Because the accumulator is a linear
//! sum of `i16` weight columns, `prev - removed + added` equals a from-scratch
//! refresh of the post-move position exactly (bit-for-bit under wrapping `i16`).
//!
//! ## Accumulator layout
//!
//! Two per-perspective `i16` vectors of [`HIDDEN_SIZE`], each in its own
//! 64-byte-aligned buffer (reusing [`crate::Aligned64`] from the loader child).
//! Index `[Color::Black]` always holds Black's half and `[Color::White]` always
//! holds White's half — the side-to-move reordering happens only in the output
//! transform, exactly as the reference and the C++ header do it.
//!
//! ## Output transform (pairwise element-wise multiply)
//!
//! SFNN-1536's feature transformer emits `HalfDimensions = HIDDEN_SIZE` values
//! per perspective, which the output transform folds to `HIDDEN_SIZE / 2` bytes
//! by pairing lane `j` with lane `j + HIDDEN_SIZE/2`: each is clamped to
//! `[0, 254]` (the post-×2-scale analogue of `[0, 127]`), multiplied, and
//! shifted right by 9. The two perspectives are laid out
//! `[stm-half | ~stm-half]`, so the full buffer is [`FT_OUTPUT_DIMS`] bytes.
//! This mirrors the `#else` (scalar) branch of `TransformFeatures` in the C++
//! header: `output = unsigned(clamp(s0,0,254) * clamp(s1,0,254)) / 512`.
