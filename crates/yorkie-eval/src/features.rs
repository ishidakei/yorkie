//! `HalfKA_hm2` active-feature index extraction over `yorkie-state::Position`.
//!
//! SFNN-1536 uses `Features::FeatureSet<Features::HalfKA_hm2<Side::kFriend>>`
//! (see `eval/nnue/architectures/sfnn-1536.h`). This
//! module ports the index math of that feature set — full-refresh path only —
//! onto this workspace's `Position` API.
//!
//! The C++ ground truth lives at
//! `eval/nnue/features/half_ka_hm2.{h,cpp}`; the
//! index arithmetic is a faithful port of the read-only Rust NNUE reference
//! implementation's `features.rs`, adapted from that reference's Position
//! API to `yorkie-state`. The two coordinate systems already agree — an
//! `yorkie-state::Square` index is `file * 9 + rank` with file `0` = shogi file
//! `1` and rank `0` = shogi rank `a`, byte-identical to YaneuraOu's `Square`
//! numbering — so the arithmetic carries over unchanged.
//!
//! ## Feature layout (identical to the reference / C++ `HalfKA_hm2`)
//!
//! A feature index is `E_KING * sq_k_code + p_adj`, where:
//! - `sq_k_code` is the perspective's own-king square, horizontally mirrored
//!   into files 1–5 (`0..45`). Mirroring the whole position around the king's
//!   file is the `hm` ("horizontal mirror") canonicalization.
//! - `p_adj` selects a plane and a square/count within it: hand planes
//!   `[0, 90)`, board planes `[90, 1548)` (friend/enemy interleaved per piece
//!   type), and a single shared king plane `[1548, 1629)` that both kings
//!   collapse into.
//!
//! The accumulator itself, and the application of a changed-index delta to it,
//! live in [`crate::transformer`].

// have differed by. A perspective whose own king moved is flagged for a full
// refresh (its whole own-king-relative index space shifts).
//
// Bit-exactness: for a perspective updated incrementally, `refresh(before) +
// added_columns - removed_columns == refresh(after)` under wrapping `i16`,
