//! Finny tables: a per-worker cache of refreshed accumulator halves, keyed by
//! the perspective's own-king square.
//!
//! A perspective whose own king moved cannot be updated differentially, so its
//! half is rebuilt from the FT biases plus all [`MAX_ACTIVE_FEATURES`] active
//! columns — roughly an order of magnitude more work than a one-piece diff, on
//! a move shogi trees are full of. But within one search the king revisits the
//! same squares over and over, so keeping one refreshed accumulator per
//! (perspective, king square) alongside the feature list it was built from
//! turns most of those rebuilds into a handful of columns.
//!
//! The reference ships the same structure dormant behind an undefined
//! `USE_FINNY_TABLES`, so this adapts code a default build never compiles.
//!
//! # The invariant
//!
//! For every initialised entry:
//!
//! ```text
//! entry.accumulation == ft_biases + sum over entry.active of ft_weights[column]
//! ```
//!
//! That mentions no position, only a feature multiset, which is why an entry
//! stays valid across nodes, searches and whole games. Only the weights
//! changing underneath can invalidate it, so the cache carries a
//! network-identity token and resets itself when the token moves.
//!
//! Applying `changed_indices(entry.active, new_active)` to the entry preserves
//! the invariant and re-establishes the accumulator identity for the new
//! position **exactly**: the accumulator is a sum of `i16` columns under
//! wrapping arithmetic, so any decomposition of the same multiset of adds and
//! subs is bit-identical.
//!
//! One boxed cache per search worker, allocated at worker setup and shared with
//! nobody, so Lazy SMP needs no locking here.
