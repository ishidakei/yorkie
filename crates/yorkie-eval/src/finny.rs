//! Finny tables: a per-worker cache of refreshed accumulator halves, keyed by
//! the perspective's own-king square.
//!
//! ## Why
//!
//! A `HalfKA_hm2` feature index embeds the perspective's own-king square, so a
//! perspective whose own king moved cannot be updated differentially: its half
//! is rebuilt from scratch by [`crate::transformer::refresh_perspective`] —
//! copy the FT biases, then add all [`MAX_ACTIVE_FEATURES`] active columns. That
//! is roughly an order of magnitude more work than a one-piece diff, and king
//! moves are frequent in a shogi tree (evasions, endgame king walks).
//!
//! Within one search the king revisits the same squares over and over. So
//! instead of rebuilding from the biases every time, keep one *refreshed*
//! accumulator per (perspective, king square) together with the active-feature
//! list it was built from, and rebuild by diffing the new active list against
//! the cached one — usually a handful of columns instead of 40.
//!
//! This is Stockfish's `AccumulatorCaches` ("finny tables"). Upstream YaneuraOu
//! added the same thing in commit `72c91d8` (`nnue_feature_transformer.h`,
//! `FinnyEntry` / `FinnyCache` / `refresh_accumulator_using_finny_entry`), but
//! ships it dormant — `USE_FINNY_TABLES` is not defined by any Makefile or
//! config header, so a default upstream build never compiles it. This module is
//! therefore an **ahead-of-pin** adaptation, not a port of live pin code; see
//! the deviation note at [`crate::Accumulator::derive_into_cached`].
//!
//! ## The invariant
//!
//! For every initialised entry:
//!
//! ```text
//! entry.accumulation == ft_biases + sum over entry.active of ft_weights[column]
//! ```
//!
//! That statement mentions no position — only a feature multiset — which is why
//! an entry stays valid across nodes, searches and whole games. The only thing
//! that can invalidate it is the weights changing underneath, so the cache
//! carries a network-identity token and resets itself when the token moves.
//!
//! Applying `(removed, added) = changed_indices(entry.active, new_active)` to
//! the entry preserves the invariant for the new list, and re-establishes the
//! accumulator identity for the new position exactly: the accumulator is a sum
//! of `i16` columns under wrapping arithmetic, so any decomposition of the same
//! multiset of adds and subs is bit-identical. The cached rebuild is therefore
//! value-invariant against a from-scratch refresh, not merely close.
//!
//! ## Ownership
//!
//! One boxed cache per search worker, allocated once at worker setup and never
//! per node. Nothing is shared between workers, so Lazy SMP needs no locking.
//! Memory is `2 * 81 * HIDDEN_SIZE * 2` bytes of accumulation (~0.5 MiB) plus
//! the 162 small index lists. Upstream gates the analogous structure on
//! `kHalfDimensions <= 4096`; `HIDDEN_SIZE` is 1536, comfortably inside it.
