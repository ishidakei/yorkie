//! Port of the reference `MovePicker` (`source/movepick.cpp`
//! at the current submodule pin), covering both the quiescence-search stages and
//! the main-search stages.
//!
//! # Stage sequences
//!
//! Not in check (`movepick.cpp`):
//!
//! * main search (`depth > 0`):
//!   `MAIN_TT → CAPTURE_INIT → GOOD_CAPTURE → QUIET_INIT → GOOD_QUIET →
//!    BAD_CAPTURE → BAD_QUIET`
//! * qsearch (`depth == 0`): `QSEARCH_TT → QCAPTURE_INIT → QCAPTURE`
//!
//! In check (both searches): `EVASION_TT → EVASION_INIT → EVASION`.
//!
//! ProbCut: `PROBCUT_TT → PROBCUT_INIT → PROBCUT`.
//!
//! # Single-buffer stage machine
//!
//! Like the reference, this picker runs the whole stage machine on **one** fixed
//! [`ExtMove`] buffer (`buf`, capacity [`MAX_MOVES`]) with index boundaries that
//! mirror the pin's pointers (`movepick.h`):
//!
//! * `cur`             — the next move to return (`select`'s cursor).
//! * `end_cur`         — the end of the segment `select` currently walks.
//! * `end_bad_captures`— the end of the SEE-losing capture region compacted into
//!   the buffer's **front** during `GOOD_CAPTURE`.
//! * `end_captures`    — the end of the captures region (`GOOD_QUIET` walks the
//!   quiets that follow it).
//! * `end_generated`   — the end of all generated moves.
//!
//! `GOOD_CAPTURE` walks the sorted captures and, for each SEE-loser, swaps it to
//! the front region `[0, end_bad_captures)` (`std::swap(*endBadCaptures++, *cur)`,
//! `movepick.cpp`), so the good ones are yielded and the bad ones accumulate
//! for `BAD_CAPTURE` to replay. The quiets are generated into the buffer *after*
//! the captures (`[end_captures, end_generated)`); `GOOD_QUIET` yields those
//! scoring `> -14000`, `BAD_QUIET` replays the rest. For qsearch / evasion /
//! ProbCut there is no good/bad split — a single `select` loop over the whole
//! sorted list reproduces `QCAPTURE` / `EVASION` / `PROBCUT`
//! (`movepick.cpp`).
//!
//! ## Generation writes `buf` directly
//!
//! Like the pin's generators (`ExtMove* generateMoves(const Position&,
//! ExtMove*)`, `movegen.h`), this port's search generators
//! ([`Position::generate_captures`] etc.) write [`ExtMove`] straight into
//! `buf`'s tail with `value: 0`, and scoring then fills each `value` **in
//! place** at the `*_INIT` stage entry. There is no intermediate
//! `Move`-typed staging vector and no per-move restaging copy. `buf` is drawn
//! from the per-thread scratch pool, so steady-state search performs **zero**
//! per-node heap allocation.
//!
//! # Staged-lazy scoring
//!
//! The reference is a lazy state machine: it scores a stage's moves *when the
//! stage is entered*, which — crucially — is **after** the earlier stages'
//! moves have been emitted and their subtrees searched (`movepick.cpp`).
//! At `depth >= 2` those subtrees run `update_all_stats` / TT-cutoff /
//! eval-diff updates that write the very history cells a later stage's scoring
//! reads (grandchildren move the same colour, touching `mainHistory[us]` and the
//! `(ss-1..4)` continuation planes at `[us piece][to]`), so a construction-time
//! snapshot of the scores orders moves differently from the reference. This port
//! therefore mirrors the reference exactly: [`MovePicker::next_move`] takes the
//! live [`WorkerHistories`] and scores each stage at stage-entry time, reading
//! whatever those tables hold at that moment:
//!
//! * `CAPTURE_INIT` scores the captures on the first `next_move` after the TT
//!   move's subtree was searched (`movepick.cpp`).
//! * `QUIET_INIT` scores the quiets after the good captures' subtrees were
//!   searched (`movepick.cpp`).
//!
//! The continuation planes are held as flat plane **indices** into the live
//! [`ContinuationHistory`] (`cont_planes`, the reference's `contHist` array of
//! `(ss-1-i)->continuationHistory` pointers, `yaneuraou-search.cpp`),
//! never as snapshots, so an update to those planes between stages is seen by
//! the later stage's scoring exactly as in the reference.
//!
//! *Move generation* itself (not scoring) is a pure function of the position and
//! carries no history dependence, so *when* a list is materialized never changes
//! its contents or order. Following the reference, every list is generated at
//! its `*_INIT` stage entry, not at construction: `CAPTURE_INIT` /
//! `QCAPTURE_INIT` / `PROBCUT_INIT` generate the captures and `EVASION_INIT`
//! generates the evasions at stage entry (`movepick.cpp`), and
//! `QUIET_INIT` generates the quiets. A picker abandoned
//! at the `*_TT` stage by a TT-move beta cutoff therefore never pays for any
//! generation — the reference's whole point in deferring it. The `skipQuiets`
//! flag is honoured at `QUIET_INIT` (skip the quiet generation and scoring) and
//! at `GOOD_QUIET` / `BAD_QUIET` (skip emitting), exactly as the reference
//! checks it (`movepick.cpp`).
//!
//! # Lazy SEE at yield
//!
//! SEE is evaluated **lazily, at yield time**, exactly as the pin does: the
//! `GOOD_CAPTURE` stage calls `see_ge(m, -value / 18)` on each capture as
//! `select` reaches it (`movepick.cpp`), and `PROBCUT` calls
//! `see_ge(m, threshold)` per move (`movepick.cpp`). On an early beta cutoff
//! the remaining captures' SEE is never computed — work that SEE-scoring every
//! capture at `CAPTURE_INIT` would pay regardless of the cutoff. QSearch /
//! evasion lists carry no SEE split and are simply full-sorted.
//!
//! # Scoring (`movepick.cpp`)
//!
//! * Captures: `captureHistory[pc][to][type_of(captured)] + 7 * PieceValue[captured]`.
//!   `GOOD_CAPTURE` keeps a capture iff `see_ge(m, -value / 18)` where `value` is
//!   that move's own score (`movepick.cpp`).
//! * Quiets: `2*mainHistory + 2*pawnHistory + contHist[0] + contHist[1] +
//!   contHist[2] + contHist[3] + contHist[5] + (direct-check ? 16384 : 0) +
//!   (ply < LOW_PLY_HISTORY_SIZE ? 8*lowPlyHistory/(1+ply) : 0)`. `QUIET_INIT`
//!   sorts with `partial_insertion_sort` limit `-3560 * depth`; `GOOD_QUIET`
//!   keeps `value > -14000`.
//! * Evasions: capturing evasion `PieceValue[victim] + (1 << 28)` (outranks every
//!   quiet), quiet evasion `mainHistory + continuationHistory[0]`.
//!
//! # TT move
//!
//! The `*_TT` stages yield the TT move first, and every later stage skips it
//! (`select`'s `*cur != ttMove` guard, `movepick.cpp`). The reference gates
//! the TT move on `pseudo_legal` (`movepick.cpp`) and lets the search
//! loop drop an illegal one with `pos.legal(move)`. This port applies **both**
//! at construction — [`Position::pseudo_legal`] then [`Position::is_legal`]
//! — because this engine's search loops rely on the picker's
//! "yielded moves are legal" contract rather than re-testing legality per move.
//! The accepted set is therefore exactly the reference's (pseudo-legal ∧ legal),
//! with one deliberate exception: a TT move that *continues* a perpetual check
//! is accepted here, as in the pin — repetition is handled by scoring
//! (`is_repetition`), never by filtering the move out of the picker.
//!
//! # Legality filtering: at generation vs at yield
//!
//! The reference generators are pseudo-legal; the search loop drops illegal
//! moves with `if (!pos.legal(move)) continue`. This port keeps the "yielded
//! moves are legal" contract but must place the legality filter where it does
//! not disturb move *ordering* (unchanged by that placement):
//!
//! * **Captures / evasions / ProbCut** are **full-sorted** (limit `i32::MIN`),
//!   so removing illegal moves at generation is order-neutral (every element is
//!   promoted, so `partial_insertion_sort`'s promotion swap `*p = *++sortedEnd`
//!   is a self-assignment — see [`MovePicker::next_move`]'s `CAPTURE_INIT` arm).
//! * **Quiets** are **partial-sorted** with the depth-scaled limit
//!   `-3560 * depth`, whose promotion swaps relocate tail elements. The set of
//!   elements in the buffer therefore changes the emitted order, so the raw
//!   pseudo-legal buffer (illegal quiets and the TT move included) is scored and
//!   sorted, and legality is filtered only at yield in `GOOD_QUIET` / `BAD_QUIET`
//!   — exactly mirroring the reference's `MoveList<QUIETS>` + search-loop gate.
