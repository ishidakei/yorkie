//! Quiescence search — a faithful port of the reference
//! `Search::YaneuraOuWorker::qsearch`
//! (`source/engine/yaneuraou-engine/yaneuraou-search.cpp`,
//! lines 4432–5136 at the current submodule pin).
//!
//! Every structural detail here is derived from the **code** at that pin, not
//! from the stale design-note comment block at the top of the reference
//! function (which describes an older `DEPTH_QS_CHECKS` / `DEPTH_QS_RECAPTURES`
//! design that no longer exists — see the movepick module docs). Line numbers
//! in the comments below point into that reference file.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! The reference signature is `template<NodeType, bool ReadTT> Value
//! qsearch(Position&, Stack*, Value alpha, Value beta)` — no depth parameter.
//! Both `PvNode` and `ReadTT` are invariant down the whole recursion (qsearch
//! always recurses with the *same* node type, unlike the main search), so they
//! are stored once on [`QSearch`] rather than threaded through every call.
//!
//! # Evaluation
//!
//! Like the reference, this port maintains the NNUE accumulator **incrementally**
//! across `do_move` / `undo_move`. Each worker owns a private
//! accumulator stack ([`QSearch::acc_stack`]): the root position is refreshed
//! once, and every `do_move` derives the child accumulator from its parent by
//! rewriting only the feature columns the move touches (the move-derived
//! [`yorkie_eval::MoveDelta`]; a perspective whose own king moved is refreshed
//! from scratch), pushing it for the child and popping it on `undo_move`. A null
//! move touches no pieces, so the child reuses the parent slot unchanged. The
//! six evaluation sites then read the live accumulator through
//! [`yorkie_eval::evaluate_with`] — no per-node full refresh. `yorkie-eval`
//! guarantees the differential accumulator is **bit-identical** to a
//! from-scratch refresh, so the returned static evals are exactly the
//! reference's; a debug-only assertion in [`QSearch::static_eval`] re-checks
//! that identity against [`yorkie_eval::evaluate`] at every evaluation point.
//! Eager derivation on every `do_move` (rather than the reference's lazy
//! refresh-on-first-evaluation) is behaviourally identical — the accumulator a
//! node evaluates is the same either way — and simply skips the bookkeeping for
//! deferring it.
//!
//! # History tables
//!
//! qsearch reads **one** set of live worker history tables ([`WorkerHistories`])
//! — the same tables the interior [`QSearch::search`] updates — for its move
//! ordering (leaf [`MovePicker`]), its evasion continuation-plane scoring, and
//! its [`QSearch::correction_value`]. There are no qsearch-private history
//! duplicates: once the interior search updates `self.histories`, every
//! subsequent leaf qsearch sees those updates, exactly as the reference reads
//! the worker's tables everywhere. qsearch itself never *writes*
//! the tables (no history update occurs inside a pure-qsearch subtree), so with
//! untouched tables move ordering is pure MVV for captures and the capture-bias
//! for evasions, and `correction_value` is eval-neutral.
//!
//! # Transposition table
//!
//! The reference holds a single `TTWriter` from the Step-3 probe and writes
//! through it — including the *tail* write that happens after the whole move
//! loop. In safe Rust a writer borrowing the table cannot outlive the recursive
//! calls that also mutate the table, so instead the node captures the entry's
//! *location* ([`yorkie_storage::TtSlot`]) at the Step-3 [`TranspositionTable::locate`]
//! probe and every write site writes to that exact slot via
//! [`QSearch::tt_store`]. Because the slot is an index pair (not a re-probe), the
//! tail write lands on the reference's held-writer entry even after a child has
//! churned the cluster — a re-probe there would re-run the replacement selection
//! against the churned cluster and could pick a different slot, drifting the
//! stored TT state and the node counts of later probes (the depth-3 parity gate
//! is sensitive to exactly that).
