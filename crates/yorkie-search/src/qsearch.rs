//! Quiescence search, ported from `Search::YaneuraOuWorker::qsearch`
//! (`yaneuraou-search.cpp`).
//!
//! Everything here follows the reference's **code**, not the stale design note
//! above that function, which describes a `DEPTH_QS_CHECKS` /
//! `DEPTH_QS_RECAPTURES` design the code does not implement.
//!
//! The NNUE accumulator is derived eagerly on every `do_move` rather than
//! lazily on first evaluation as the reference does; both reach the same
//! accumulator. qsearch reads the worker history tables and never writes them,
//! so no history update occurs inside a pure-qsearch subtree.
//!
//! The reference holds one `TTWriter` from the Step-3 probe and writes through
//! it, including the *tail* write after the whole move loop. In safe Rust a
//! writer borrowing the table cannot outlive the recursive calls that also
//! mutate it, so the node captures the entry's *location* at Step 3 and every
//! write site targets that slot. Re-probing instead would re-run the
//! replacement selection against a cluster a child has since churned, and could
//! pick a different slot.
