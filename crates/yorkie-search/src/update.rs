//! History-table **update** machinery — a faithful port of the reference
//! `update_all_stats`, `update_quiet_histories`, `update_continuation_histories`

//! The functions here are decoupled from the search body: they operate on a

//! [`SearchStackCell`]s, with the reference's `(ss-N)->continuationHistory`
//! pointers modelled as flat indices into the continuation tables. `qsearch`
//! reconciles [`SearchStackCell`] with its live search stack and supplies the

//!
//! Line numbers in the comments point into the reference file above; all
//! arithmetic is integer (division truncates toward zero, as Rust's `/` does),
