//! History-table skeletons the [`MovePicker`] consults for move ordering.
//!
//! Each table is either zero-filled (via `new`) or filled once with the
//! reference's `clear()` init constant (via
//! [`fill`](CapturePieceToHistory::fill)). The init constants matter for parity:
//! before any update lands, a uniformly filled table contributes a constant to
//! every score, so first-search move ordering is a pure function of those
//! constants and the static terms (MVV for captures, the capture bias for
//! evasions) — which is what makes the depth-1 node counts reproducible.
//!
//! The types mirror the reference tables the `MovePicker` constructors take
//! (`source/movepick.h`, `history.h`):
//!
//! * [`CapturePieceToHistory`] — `captureHistory[pc][to][type_of(captured)]`,
//!   consulted by `score<CAPTURES>` (`movepick.cpp`). Init `-678`.
//! * [`ButterflyHistory`] — `mainHistory[us][move]`, consulted by the quiet
//!   branches of `score<QUIETS>` / `score<EVASIONS>` (`movepick.cpp`).
//!   Init `0`.
//! * [`PieceToHistory`] — one plane of the continuation history; the main-search
//!   quiet score reads planes `[0][1][2][3][5]` and the evasion quiet score
//!   reads plane `[0]` (`movepick.cpp`). Init `-523`.
//! * [`LowPlyHistory`] — `lowPlyHistory[ply][move]`, consulted by `score<QUIETS>`
//!   near the root (`movepick.cpp`). Init `98`, re-filled per `go`.
//!
//! The `pawnHistory` and `correctionHistory` tables do not live here: they are
//! SHARED between the worker threads of one NUMA node, so they sit in
//! [`SharedHistories`] with atomic entries. At `thread_count == 1` that type is
//! byte-identical to a per-worker `PawnHistory` / `UnifiedCorrectionHistory`
//! copy, so single-thread node counts are unaffected by the sharing.
//!
//! The entries are `i16` to match the reference's `StatsEntry` width. The
//! indexing helpers below are sized to hold every index the picker can present.
//!
//! # Backing store
//!
//! Each table's heap array is allocated through the shared huge-page allocator
//! ([`yorkie_storage::LargePageArray`] for the flat `i16` / atomic tables,
//! [`yorkie_storage::LargePageBox`] for the fixed-shape continuation-correction
//! table),
//! mirroring the reference, which allocates every dynamically sized history
//! table with `make_unique_large_page` (`history.h`) and carries the
//! fixed-shape ones inside the large-page-allocated `Worker` object
//! (`thread.cpp`). The allocator affects placement only — element type,
//! index maths, init values, and clear semantics are those of the reference.
