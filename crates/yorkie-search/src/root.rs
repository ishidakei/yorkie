//! Root search data types and helpers — the `go depth 1..3` path of the
//! reference `Search::YaneuraOuWorker::start_searching` /
//! `iterative_deepening` / `search<Root>`
//! (`source/engine/yaneuraou-engine/yaneuraou-search.cpp`
//! and `source/thread.cpp` at the pinned submodule commit `76d58ef`).
//!
//! This module holds the *pure* pieces: the [`RootMove`] / [`RootOutcome`]
//! value types, the [`generate_root_moves`] root-move list builder, and the
//! [`declaration_win`] nyugyoku predicate. The search glue that drives the
//! iterative-deepening loop, the aspiration windows, and the `nodeType == Root`
//! entry into the shared [`crate::qsearch`] search body lives on
//! [`crate::qsearch::QSearch`] (method `run_root`) so that it shares the same
//! node counter, transposition table, search stack, worker history tables, and
//! NNUE network as the interior search and quiescence search it recurses into.
//!
//! The root is searched through the same shared body as the interior PV / NonPV
//! nodes (`QSearch::search` with `root_node == true`), so from iteration 2 the
//! main-search pruning steps and the post-loop `update_all_stats` /
//! `update_correction_history` updates all run at the root exactly as the
//! reference guards make them. `MultiPV > 1` is not modelled.
