//! Transposition table — a faithful port of the YaneuraOu reference
//! (`source/tt.h` / `tt.cpp` at the pinned submodule
//! commit), specialised to the engine's default build configuration.
//!
//! # Configuration
//!
//! The reference is heavily `#define`-parameterised; we mirror the **default**
//! build (`source/config.h`):
//!
//! - `HASH_KEY_BITS == 64` → the position key is a plain 64-bit `Key64`, and
//!   the in-cluster key fragment stored per entry is the key's low 16 bits.
//! - `TT_CLUSTER_SIZE == 3` → each cluster holds three [`TTEntry`]s, so the
//!   per-entry key fragment type (`TTE_KEY_TYPE`) is `uint16_t`, an entry is
//!   10 bytes, and a cluster is exactly 32 bytes (`3 × 10 + 2` padding).
//!
//! These choices are load-bearing for search-node parity with the reference:
//! the cluster size and the `clusterCount = mb·2²⁰ / sizeof(Cluster)` sizing
//! arithmetic together decide which positions collide, and the in-cluster
//! replacement policy decides which entry survives a collision — both feed
//! directly into how many nodes qsearch visits.
//!
//! ## The `tt-entry16` feature
//!
//! The `tt-entry16` cargo feature (additive, **off** by default) is the one
//! sanctioned departure from that layout. It widens the entry to 16 bytes by
//! replacing the 16-bit key fragment with the **whole 64-bit position key**:
//!
//! | | default | `tt-entry16` |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `TteKey` (the stored key) | `u16` — the hash's low 16 bits | `u64` — the whole hash |
//! | `size_of::<TTEntry>()` | 10 | 16 |
//! | `CLUSTER_SIZE` | 3 | 2 |
//! | `size_of::<Cluster>()` | 32 (`3 × 10 + 2` padding) | 32 (`2 × 16`, no padding) |
//!
//! The five payload fields (`depth8`, `gen_bound8`, `move16`, `value16`,
//! `eval16`) are byte-for-byte the same in both layouts — the entire size
//! increase goes into the key, and no field is added. Position identity at
//! probe and store is then full 64-bit equality rather than a 16-bit compare,
//! so a hit is exact instead of carrying a ~1/65536 per-entry false-hit rate.
//!
//! Everything else is untouched: the cluster is still 32 bytes, so the
//! `clusterCount` arithmetic, the table sizing and the cluster-index
//! computation are literally the same code; only the per-cluster scan runs over
//! 2 entries instead of 3, which means the same byte budget holds 2/3 as many
//! entries. Generation handling, the replacement policy, mate-value handling
//! and the atomics-per-field threading model are all shared between the two
//! layouts.
//!
//! A `tt-entry16` build's search output is nonetheless tied to neither the
//! default build's nor the reference's. Both changes — exact identity, and a
//! third fewer entries — move which probes hit, so that output is free to
//! diverge, and nothing here promises otherwise. (It happens not to diverge on
//! the fixtures this repository pins, because those run against tables far too
//! sparse for either change to bite; that is an observation about the fixtures,
//! not a guarantee about the feature.) The default build is byte-identical to
//! what it was before the feature existed.
//!
//! # Layering
//!
//! The Storage layer must not depend on the State
//! layer, so this module speaks in primitives: the position key is a `u64`,
//! the side-to-move is a `u8` (0 = Black, 1 = White, matching the reference's
//! `Color` being folded into cluster-index bit 0), and the best move is stored
//! as its low-16-bit fragment (`u16`, the reference's `Move16`). The Search
//! layer — which owns both this table and `yorkie-state` — is responsible for
//! widening the 16-bit move back to a full move and for validating it against
//! the actual position; that reconstruction is out of scope here.
//!
//! # Threading
//!
//! The table is shared across search threads as `Arc<TranspositionTable>`: the
//! read/write path ([`TranspositionTable::probe`] / [`TranspositionTable::locate`]
//! / [`TranspositionTable::write_at`]) takes `&self`, so several workers can hit
//! one instance concurrently. Each entry field is an atomic accessed with
//! [`Ordering::Relaxed`] loads/stores — the Rust-sound equivalent of the
//! reference's racy, lock-free `TTEntry` (`source/tt.h`),
//! which reads and writes plain members across threads with no synchronisation.
//! On x86-64 a relaxed atomic load/store lowers to a plain `MOV`, so the
//! single-thread codegen is identical to the previous plain-field layout and the
//! data layout is unchanged (a flat array of fixed-size 32-byte clusters).
//!
//! ## Torn-entry tolerance
//!
//! Relaxed atomics make each *field* access indivisible, but an entry is six
//! fields with no cross-field atomicity: a concurrent write on another thread
//! can land between this thread's field reads, so [`TTEntry::read`] may return a
//! payload that mixes an old key fragment with a new value/move (a *torn*
//! entry). The reference tolerates exactly this. Correctness does not depend on
//! entries being coherent: a stale or mismatched key fragment simply reads back
//! as a miss or a wrong-position hit, and the Search layer validates every TT
//! move against the actual position before trusting it (see the module docs
//! above) — the shared-atomic layout here makes no coherence promise beyond
//! per-field atomicity.
//!
//! ## Single-thread decision-identity
//!
//! With one searcher the atomics are never contended, so every field read
//! observes the value the same thread last wrote: `probe` / `locate` /
//! `write_at` make the exact same cluster-geometry, entry-selection,
//! replacement-scoring and generation decisions as the previous plain-field
//! implementation, and return the same data. The search-node parity gates are
//! the proof.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle exclusivity
//!
//! [`TranspositionTable::resize`] and [`TranspositionTable::clear`] take
//! `&mut self`: they are driver-side lifecycle operations run only while no
//! search holds the table. With the table behind an `Arc`, the driver reaches
//! them via [`Arc::get_mut`], which returns `Some` only when the refcount is 1
//! — i.e. after every search worker has been joined and dropped its clone. The
//! type system therefore enforces that a resize/clear never races a probe.
